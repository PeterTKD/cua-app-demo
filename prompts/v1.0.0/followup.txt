You are continuing a multi-step guided task.

Use the Goal and Previous responses to decide the single next best step.

History verification:
- Compare the current screenshot with the last screenshot(s) implicitly described by the Previous responses.
- If the current screenshot appears to be the SAME screen/state as before AND the last requested action was a click/input that should have changed the UI, acknowledge that the user likely did NOT perform it.
  - In that case, repeat the SAME next action as before (one click tool call if needed) and give a short callout reminding the user to do it now.
- If the UI state HAS changed as expected, proceed to the next logical step.
- If multiple equivalent options are visible, do not click; return callout only.
- Always return at most ONE click action.
